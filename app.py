              Accidents have always been a major cause for many fatalities, all around the world. Although the grounds of these fatalities can range over a lot of reasons, starting from bad roads, speeding, poor engineering plans, delayed medical aid etc. Steps can be taken on various levels to, if not completely overcome, then at least to avoid a certain percentage of the casualties caused due these accidents. Hence, EARS - Emergency Accident Reporting System which is a software that when installed in CC TV Cameras, can detect an accident and send an alert to the hospitals nearby, without any human interference, with enough information for the hospitals to act quickly, thus saving lives.
